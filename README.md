# ðŸŽ­ Playwright Automation Framework

âœ¨ **This workspace has been generated by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** âœ¨

## Getting started

### Tools & Frameworks

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript programming language, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- **[Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration)**: A modern end-to-end testing framework, facilitating [test creation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test), [execution](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests), [fixture management](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures), and [report generation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters).
- **[Playwright Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/assertions)**: Provides robust assertion capabilities for validating test outcomes.
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript, ensuring code consistency and detecting potential errors.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: An opinionated code formatter, ensuring consistent code style across the project.
- **[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)**: A CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub, automating workflows like test execution on pull requests. Enhanced with [Playwright's CI guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro).

### Prerequisites

- This project works on node.js server. Whatever libraries we are going to use we need node.js to interact with the browser.
- Download and Install node Js on your machine from here ðŸ‘‰ [Node Js Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Installation

- Clone repository

  ```bash
  https://github.com/ashishgoyal120/qa-playwright.git

  ```

- Navigate to project folder and install npm packages using:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Understand .env file

  1. under enviornment folder there is .env.template for refrence.
  2. Use .env.template file to create a .env file and update the values.
  3. .env file is ignored in gitignore. Do not change it as we do not want to push the .env file to git.
  4. By Default 'staging' environment will be used for test execution.To provide the ENVIRONMENT use .env file.Or use the below command to run on different environment.
     bash

     ```bash

     ENVIRONMENT=staging npx playwright test examples

     ```

     powershell

     ```powershell

     $env:ENVIRONMENT="staging"
     npx playwright test examples

     ```

  5. If ENVIRONMENT provided is other than 'staging' or 'development' then test execution process will exit. Check environmentConfig.ts file for more details.
